# tig - git written backwards
Javascript Node.js version control system. As complicated as git backwards.
## Usage
Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) first.

You can use tig in one (or more) of 3 ways:
1. Installing globally `npm i -g @samthegitguy/tig`
2. Installing locally as a dev dependecy - Recommended for standard use `cd project/directory && npm i --save-dev @samthegitguy/tig` 
3. Installing as a production dependecy - use if you are using the tig API `cd project/directory && npm i @samthegitguy/tig`
## Development
### Prerequisites
* We recommend a installation of VSCode
* Node.js
### What about unit tests?
We don't write bugs so we don't have to write tests.
